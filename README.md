# IOT-HMI
Internet of Things with Human Machine Interface

HMI (Human Machine Interface) is the user interface in a manufacturing or
process control system. It provides a graphics-based visualization of an
industrial control and monitoring system. Machine builders are connecting their
automation systems to the Internet of Things (IoT), and many Human Machine
Interface (HMI) software solutions enable IoT connectivity in a variety of ways.
In this project we are using x86 based processor named intel galileo for
development of HMI along with IOT support.

The architecture of this project is as follows:-
